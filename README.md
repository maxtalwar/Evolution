# Evolution
Generates a population of creatures and has them adapt to surviving in the simulated landscape. Most populations don't survive, but a few manage to hold on and eventually experience exponential population growth. Animals have attributes speed, strength, their threshold for hunger, and their current hunger. Interestingly, the animals seem to optimize increasing their threshold for hunger over getting stronger and faster.
